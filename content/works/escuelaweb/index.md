This was my first important job, where I started as a trainee. Later I started to teach specific topics on some of the school's classes; and then I taught some big courses like "Basic HTML5 And CSS3", teaching about the most important HTML tags, good practices when you write code, teaching some tools for faster development (GIT, SASS, GULP) and a little bit of Javascript; and about Wordpress and Wordpress Theming (PHP Theming).
